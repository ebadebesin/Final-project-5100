Quiz 1 to Chapter 4
What is the difference between type and variable?

Type is the description of a specific variable while variable are the names or data given to the type. 
Also, for type, it does not allocate memory but variables allocate memory.

Types refer to the data
type of a variable, such as integer, float, or string. 
Variables are the names given to memory locations that hold values.


Variables are named storage locations in a computer program that hold data. 
Each variable has a type, which specifies the kind of data it can store 
(e.g., integer, float, string).

Types define the characteristics or description of the data, such as its size and allowed operations.
Variables, on the other hand, are instances of these types and are used to store specific values.
