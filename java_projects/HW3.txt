In a separate document, write the description of the Java naming convention for classes, interfaces, methods,
variables, and constants.

ANSWER
-------

Java follows specific naming conventions to improve code readability and maintainability. 
Here's a breakdown of the recommended conventions for different elements:

**Classes and Interfaces**
-------------------------
Start with an uppercase letter.
Class names should be nouns
Use PascalCase: Each word in the name should start with an uppercase letter.
Use whole words-avoid acronyms and abbreviations (unless the abbreviation is much more widely used than the long form, such as URL or HTML).
Example: MyClass, MyInterface

**Methods**
---------
Start with a lowercase letter.
Methods should be verbs
Use camelCase: Each word after the first should start with an uppercase letter.
Example: myMethod, doSomething

**Variables**
-----------
Start with a lowercase letter.
Use camelCase: Same as methods.
Variable names should not
start with underscore _ or dollar sign $ characters,
Example: myVariable, counter

**Constants**
-----------
Use all uppercase letters.
Use underscores to separate words.
Example: MAX_VALUE, PI

**Additional Guidelines:**
-------------------------
Avoid using single-letter variable names except for simple loop counters (e.g., i, j, k).
Choose meaningful names that reflect the purpose of the element.
Use consistent naming conventions throughout your codebase.

Example:

Java
public class MyClass {
    private static final int MAX_AGE = 100;

    public void myMethod(String myString) {
        int counter = 0;
        while (counter < MAX_AGE) {
            // ...
            counter++;
        }
    }
}
